# Sajan's Showcase
A showcase of my skills in iOS and Swift.

Extensions:
You can see my love of extensions in AlertExtension and TableViewExtension. Extensions are great because they allow me to refactor boilerplate code into a single line function. It reduces friction when I want to quicly build or destory features in an application.

Programmatically create UI:
Like many starting out in iOS development, I began with storyboards. I then evolved and began to find them a nuisance, especially since I could not subclass views to easily create a new view. I found programatiaclly creating views was the best when it comes to object oriented programming.

MVVM:
You can see how I like to apply MVVM in action. I try to remove as much code from the controller as possible. Abstraction and information hiding is huge for me. Usually, my tableView methods are reduces to a few lines, at most. You can see how I used extension for presenting alerts and action sheets easily. I try to work with high level objects (structs and classes) in the controller and more primitive types and type conversions in the viewmodel (string formatting and arrays).
